\chapter{Fun with Bots Inc}

\mainauthor{St\'ephane Ducasse}

The goal of this chapter is to get you started with some programming by steering graphical robots. We use the contents of the book Squeak: Learn programming with Robots by Stéphane Ducasse, Apress Publishers, 2005 (http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/botsinc/). 

More information on http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=444 

\section*{Getting the environment}
Go to http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/botsinc/ and download the distribution for your machine. 
Follow the instructions described page http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/botsinc/installation/ (Unzip it and drap the file name ready.image on the exe file). 

Watch the videos you can find at http://www.iam.unibe.ch/~ducasse/Web/BotsInc/Videos/ and reproduce them during the following exercises.

\section{Create and talking}


Create a robot and talk to it (video 1). You can get the list of action bringing the menu and selecting vocabulary.

\begin{itemize}
\item Draw a square of 200 pixels
\item Draw a rectangle of 100 and 200 pixels
\end{itemize}

\section{Writing Scripts}
Direct interaction does not scale. So we propose you to write scripts as shown in the video 3. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Write a script that draws a square of 200 pixels.
\item Write a script that draws a rectangle of 100 and 200 pixels.
\end{itemize}


\section{Looping}
Read chapter 7 on loop http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/botsinc/chaptersamples/

\begin{itemize}
\item Using a loop write a script that draws a square of 100.
\item Using a loop write a script that draws a rectangle of 100 and 200 pixels.
\item Write a script that draws a stair case (experience 7.7)
\item Try to reproduce Figure 7-11.
\end{itemize}

\section{Variables}
Watch video 5 that introduces the use of variables. There the variable l is incremented
each step of the loop. Redo the experiment shown by the video. Using the same technique, draw a staircase whose step increase regularly. Do not watch at video 6.


\section{Methods: Naming Scripts}
Scripts are powerful but difficult to reuse. First get a code browser (an editor to define method) (video 7, 8 and 9), then read the extra chapter available at http://www.iam.unibe.ch/$\sim$ducasse/Teaching/CoursAnnecy/0506-MDSI/4916\_Ch12\_FINAL.pdf.

Follow the chapter and define the methods asked there and to the exercises.

\section{Composing methods}
Read chapter 13 available http://smallwiki.unibe.ch/botsinc/chaptersamples/ and do the exercises. 

Now using the method square define the following Figures:

\includegraphics[width=6cm]{damier}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{cubesandcentpyra}


\includegraphics[width=6cm]{corridor}
\includegraphics[width=6cm]{mire}

Hints: it may be appropriate to define another method square that draws a square
centered around a point.
