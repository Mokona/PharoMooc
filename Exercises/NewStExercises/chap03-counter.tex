\chapter{Counter Example}
This document provides the initial exercise you should do to be
familiar with Smalltalk syntax and VisualWorks 7.


\section*{A Simple Counter}
We want you to implement a simple counter that follows the small example given
below. Please note that we will ask you to define a test for this example.

\begin{code}
|counter|
counter := SimpleCounter new.
counter increment; increment.
counter decrement.
counter value = 1
\end{code}


\section*{Creating your own class}
In this part you will create your first class. In traditional Smalltalk environments a class is associated with a category (a folder containing the classes of your project).

\storespecific{When we are using \store, categories are replaced
by packages. Therefore in \vw with \store you define a package and
define your class within this package.} The steps we will do are
the same ones every  time you create a class, so memorize them
well. We are going to create a class \texttt{SimpleCounter} in a
\category called \texttt{DemoCounter}. Note that you all will be
versioning your code in the \store database -with the rest of the
students of the lecture-, so every package (each one belonging to
different group of students) must have a different name. Therefore you
should prefix them with your initials or group name.

\storespecific{
\subsection*{Creating a Package}
In the System Browser, click on the line \texttt{Local Image}
located in the left-most upper pane (left button of the mouse) and
select \texttt{New}$>>$\texttt{Package}. The system will ask you a
name. You should write \texttt{DemoCounter}, prefixed with your initials or group name. This new package will
be created and added to the list (see Figure
\ref{fig:packageCreated}).

With the package selected, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:packageCreated}, you can edit its properties by clicking the \texttt{properties tab} of the editor. Properties you will likely have to set one day are the dependencies on other packages (for example, when you subclass a class from another package), post-load actions (an expression that is executed after loading that package from Store, for example to initialize something) and pre-unload actions (an expression that is executed just before unloading a package from your image, for example to close any windows from an application). In the context of this exercise we do not need any of this, so leave the properties alone for now.}

\squeakspecific{
\subsection*{Creating a Class category}
In the System Browser, click on the left pane and select \emph{add}. The
system will ask you a name. You should write \texttt{DemoCounter}.
This new \category will be created and added to the list.}

\vwspecific{\subsection*{With Namespace} In \vw you can also
define your own namespace. If you do so you will have to define
your namespace (in the \emph{class} menu of the browser) before you can define the class in this new namespace. For now we suggest you to use the default namespace called
\ct{Smalltalk}. Note that classes (or methods or namespaces) can be moved to other namespaces or packages anytime.}

\end{figure}}

Creating a class requires five steps. They consist basically of
editing the class definition template to specify the class you
want to create. \storespecific{\textit{Before you begin, make sure
that only the package \texttt{DemoCounter} is selected.} (See
Figure ~\ref{fig:packageCreated})}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Superclass Specification}. First, you should replace
the word \texttt{NameOfSuperclass} with the word \texttt{\vwspecific{Core.}Object}\vwspecific{\footnote{We will see when we will be building a user interface for this object that we will change its superclass}}. Thus, you specify the superclass of the class you are
creating.

\item \textbf{Class Name}. Next, you should fill in the name of
your class by replacing the word \texttt{NameOfClass} with the
word \texttt{SimpleCounter}. Take care that the name of the class
starts with a capital letter and that you do not remove the \#
sign in front of \texttt{NameOfClass}.

\item \textbf{Instance Variable Specification}. Then, you should
fill in the names of the instance variables of this class. We need
one instance variable called \texttt{value}. You add it by
replacing the words \textit{instVarName1} and
\textit{instVarName2} with the word \texttt{value}.Take
care that you leave the string quotes!

\item \textbf{Class Variable Specification}. As we do not need any class variable make sure that the argument  for the class instance variables is an empty string (\ct{classInstanceVariableNames: ''}).

\item \textbf{Compilation}. That's it! We now have a filled-in
class definition for the class \ct{SimpleCounter}. To define it, we still have to \textbf{compile} it. Therefore,
select the \textbf{accept} option from the operate menu
(right-click button of the mouse). The class
\texttt{SimpleCounter} is now compiled and immediately added to the system.
\end{enumerate}

As we are disciplined developers, we provide a comment to
\texttt{SimpleCounter} class by clicking \textbf{Comment} tab of
the class definition (in the figure ~\ref{fig:packageCreated} the
\textbf{Comment} is highlighted). You can write the following
comment:

\begin{code}
SimpleCounter is a concrete class which supports incrementing
and decrementing a counter.

Instance Variables:\\
value\tab \texttt{<}Integer\texttt{>}
\end{code}

Select \textbf{accept} to store this class comment in the class.


\section*{Defining protocols and methods}
In this part you will use the System Browser to learn how to add
protocols and methods.


\subsection*{Creating and Testing methods}
The class we have defined has one instance variable \ct{value}. You should
remember that in Smalltalk, everything is an object, that instance variables are private to the object and  that the only way to interact with an object is by sending messages to it.

Therefore, there is no other mechanism to access the instance variables
from outside an object than sending a message to the object. What you can do is to define messages that return the value of the instance variable of a class. Such methods are called \textbf{accessors}, and it is a common practice to always define and use them. We start to create an accessor method for our
instance variable \texttt{value}.

Remember that every method belongs to a protocol. These protocols are just
a group of methods without any language semantics, but convey important
navigation information for the reader of your class. Although protocols
can have any name, Smalltalk programmers follow certain conventions for
naming these protocols. If you define a method and are not sure what
protocol it should be in, first go through existing code and try to
find a fitting name.


\paragraph{An important remark:} \textit{Accessors} can be defined in protocols
\ct{accessing} or \ct{private}.  Use the
\ct{accessing} protocol when a client object (like an
interface) really needs to access your data. Use \ct{private}
to clearly state that no client should use the accessor. This is
purely a convention. There is no way in Smalltalk to enforce
access rights like \emph{private} in C++ or Java.  To emphasize that objects are
not just data structure but provide services that are more
elaborated than just accessing data, put your accessors  in a
\ct{private} protocol. As a good practice, if you are not sure
then define your accessors in a \ct{private} protocol and
once some clients really need access, create
a protocol \ct{accessing} and move your methods there. Note
that this discussion does not seem to be very important in the
context of this specific simple example. However, this question is
central to the notion of object and encapsulation of the data. An
important side effect of this discussion is that you should always
ask yourself when you, as a client of an object, are using an
accessor if the object is really well defined and if it does not
need extra functionality.

\exercise Decide in which protocol you are going to put the
accessor for \ct{value}. We now create the accessor method for the
instance variable \ct{value}. Start by selecting the class
\ct{DemoCounter} in a browser, and make sure the \textbf{Instance}
tab is selected (in the figure ~\ref{fig:packageCreated}, the
\textbf{Instance} tab is in the middle of the window). Create a
new protocol clicking the right-button of the mouse on the pane of
methods categories, and choosing \ct{New}, and give a name. Select
the newly created protocol. Then in the bottom pane, the edit
field displays a method template laying out the default structure
of a method. Replace the template with the following method
definition:

\begin{code}
value
  "return the current value of the value instance variable"

  ^value

\end{code}

This defines a method called \ct{value}, taking no
arguments, having a method comment and returning the instance
variable \ct{value}. Then choose \textbf{accept} in the
operate menu (right button of the mouse) to compile the method. You
can now test your new method by typing and evaluating the next
expression in a Workspace, in the Transcript, or any text editor \ct{SimpleCounter new value}.

\vwspecific{To use a workspace, click on the last icon of the
launcher as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:launcher}.}

\vwspecific{
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{nlesson1Fig1.png}
\caption{The Launcher of VisualWorks.}\label{fig:launcher}
\end{center}
\end{figure}}


This expression first creates a new instance of
\ct{SimpleCounter}, and then sends the message \ct{value} to it
and retrieves the current value of \ct{value}. This should return
\ct{nil} (the default value for noninitialised instance variables;
afterwards we will create instances where \ct{value} has a
reasonable default initialisation value).


\exercise  Another method that is normally used besides the
\textit{accessor} method is a so-called \textit{mutator} method.
Such a method is used to \emph{change} the value of an instance variable
from a client. For example, the next expression first creates a
new \ct{SimpleCounter} instance and then sets the value of
\ct{value} to 7:
\begin{code}
SimpleCounter new value: 7
\end{code}


This mutator method does not currently exist, so as an exercise
write the method \ct{value:} such that, when invoked on
an instance of \ct{SimpleCouter}, the \ct{value}
instance variable is set to the argument given to the message.
Test your method by typing and evaluating the expression above.

\exercise Implement the following methods in the protocol
\ct{operations}.

\begin{code}
increment
    self value: self value + 1
decrement
    self value: self value - 1
\end{code}

\exercise Implement the following methods in the protocol
\ct{printing}
\begin{code}
printOn: aStream
    super printOn: aStream.
    aStream nextPutAll: ' with value: ',
    self  value printString.
    aStream cr.
\end{code}

Now test the methods \ct{increment} and \ct{decrement} but pay
attention that the counter value is not initialized. Try:
\begin{code}
SimpleCounter new value: 0; increment ; value.
\end{code}
Note that the method \ct{printOn:} is used when you print an
object or click on \ct{self} in an inspector.

\subsection*{Adding an instance creation method}
When we create a new instance of the class \ct{SimpleCounter}
using the message \ct{new}, we would like to obtain a well
initialized instance. To do so, we need to override the method
\ct{new} to add a call to an initialization method (invoking an
\ct{initialize} method is a very common practice! Ask for the
senders of \ct{initialize}). Notice that \ct{new} is always sent
to a class. This means that we have to define the new method on the
\emph{class side}, not on the \emph{instance side}. To define an instance creation method like the method
\ct{new} you should be on the class side, so you click on the
\textbf{Class} tab (See in the figure ~\ref{fig:packageCreated},
the \textbf{Class} is situated in the same level as the
\textbf{Instance} tab).

\exercise Define a new protocol called \ct{instance creation}, and
implement the method \ct{new} as follows:

\begin{code}
new
   "Create and return an initialized instance of SimpleCounter"
   |newInstance|
   newInstance := super new.
   newInstance initialize.
   ^ newInstance
\end{code}

This code returns a new and well initialized instance. We first
create a new instance by calling the normal creation method
(\ct{super new}), then we assign this new created instance
into the temporary variable called \ct{newInstance}. Then we
invoke the \ct{initialize} method on this new created instance
via the temporary variable and finally we return it.

Note that the previous method body is strictly equivalent to
the following one. Try to understand why they are equivalent.

\begin{code}
new
   "Create and return an initialized instance of SimpleCounter"

   ^ super new initialize
\end{code}

\subsection*{Adding an instance initialization method}
Now we have to write an initialization method that sets a default
value to the \ct{value} instance variable. However, as
we mentioned the \ct{initialize} message is sent to the newly
created instance. This means that the \ct{initialize} method
should be defined at the instance side as any method that is sent
to an instance of \ct{SimpleCounter} like \ct{increment}
and \ct{decrement}. The \ct{initialize} method does not
have specific and predefined semantics; it is just a convention to
name the method that is responsible to set up the instance
variable default values.

Therefore at the instance side, you should create a protocol
\texttt{initialize-release}, and create the following method (the body
of this method is left blank. Fill it in!).

\begin{code}
initialize
   "set the initial value of the value to 0"
\end{code}

\paragraph{Remark.} As we already mentioned, the \ct{initialize}
method is not automatically invoked by the method \ct{new}.
We had to override the method \ct{new} to call the
\ct{initialize} method. This is a weakness of the Smalltalk
libraries, so you should always check if the class that you are
creating inherits from a \ct{new} method that implements the
call to the \ct{initialize} method. It is a good practice to
add such a calling structure (\ct{new} calling
\ct{initialize}) in the root of the your class hierarchy. This
way you share the calling structure and are sure that the
\ct{initialize} method is always called for all your classes.

Now create a new instance of class \ct{SimpleCounter}. Is it
initialized by default? The following code should now work without
problem:

\begin{code}
SimpleCounter new increment
\end{code}

\subsection*{Another instance creation method}
If you want to be sure that you have really understood the
distinction between instance and class methods, you should now define
a different instance creation method named \ct{withValue:}.
This method receives an integer as argument and returns an
instance of \ct{SimpleCounter} with the specified value. The
following expression should return 20.

\begin{code}(SimpleCounter
withValue: 19) increment ; value
\end{code}


\paragraph{A Difficult Point}
Let us just think a bit! To create a new instance we said that we
should send messages (like \ct{new} and \ct{basicNew}) to
a class. For example to create an instance of
\ct{SimpleCounter} we sent \ct{new} to
\ct{SimpleCounter}. As the classes are also objects in
Smalltalk, they are instances of other classes that define the
structure and the behavior of classes. One of the classes that
represents classes as objects is \ct{Behavior}. Browse the
class \ct{Behavior}. In particular, \ct{Behavior} defines
the methods \ct{new} and \ct{basicNew} that are
responsible of creating new instances. If you did not redefine the
new message locally to the class of \ct{SimpleCounter}, when
you send the message \ct{new} to the class
\texttt{SimpleCounter}, the new method executed is the one defined
in \ct{Behavior}. Try to understand why the methods \emph{new} and \emph{basicNew} are on the instance side on class \ct{Behavior} while they are on the class side of your class.

\section*{SUnit}
Download the tutorial SUnit explained from
http://www.iam.unibe.ch/$\sim$ducasse/\-WebPages\-/Books.html and
define a \ct{TestCase} with several tests for the
\ct{SimpleCounter} class. To open the test runner execute
\begin{code}
TestRunner open
\end{code}

\section*{Saving your Work}
\storespecific{To save our work, simply publish your package. This will open a dialog where you can give a comment, version numbers and blessing. After this is set, you can press Publish and your package will be stored in the database of Store. From then on, other people can load it from there, in the same way that you would use cvs or other multi-user versioning systems.
Saving the image is also a way to save your working environment, but publishing
it saves the code in the database. You can of course both publish your package (so that other people can load it, and that you can compare it with other versions, etc.) \emph{and} save your image (so that next time that you start your image you are in the same working environment).}
\parcelspecific{To save our work, simply \textit{Publish as Parcel} your package. Normally each option should fit with our need. By pressing \textit{Publish} two files will be created DemoCounter.pcl and DemoCounter.pst\footnote{DemoCounter.pcl contains only the binary code, whereas the .pst file contains only the source code}.

After starting a new image, you can load back your application by choosing \textit{Load Parcel Named} in the menu \textit{Tools}; a dialog box will popup for entering a regular expression, just enter \texttt{Demo*}.}
