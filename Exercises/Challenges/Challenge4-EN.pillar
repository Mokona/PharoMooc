! Challenge 4

How to set up a simple game window that uses a very large scrollable game board with a huge image as the background, so that game pieces placed on that background would scroll in and out of view? 
You can get some nice maps on the web site *http://imgur.com/*. Use the following url to fetch them: *http://i.imgur.com/*. The following images *http://imgur.com/gallery/OssbQN3.jpeg* and *http://i.imgur.com/XXxgr7x.jpeg* are particularly nice map background. The solution may look like the figure below. 

!!! Hints: 
- You can create a morph from an image using ==AlphaImageMorph withForm:==.
- You can obtain the size of an image (usefull to create a PasteUpMorph of the right size) with the following messages ==width== and ==height==.
- You can download a picture using ==ZnEasy getJpeg: url==.
- Have a look at ==PasteUpMorph== this is a morph to drop stuff in. 
- To define the size  of a pasteUpMorph, use the message ==extent:==. To define the background morph of a pasteUpMorph use the message ==backgroundMorph:==.
- You will need to add Scrollbars so use a ScrollPane: Use ==aScrollPane scroller addMorph: aPasteUp== to put the scrollbar around the pasteUp.
