! Challenge 5

How to set up a simple game window that uses a very large scrollable game board with a huge image as the background, so that game pieces placed on that background would scroll in and out of view? 

!!!!Hints:
- You can create a morph from an image using ==AlphaImageMorph withForm:==
- You can download a picture using ==ZnEasy getJpeg: url==
- Have a look at ==PasteUpMorph== this is a morph to drop stuff in.
- You will need to add Scrollbars so use a ScrollPane: Use ==aScrollPane scroller addMorph: aPasteUp== to put the scrollbar around the pasteUp.
