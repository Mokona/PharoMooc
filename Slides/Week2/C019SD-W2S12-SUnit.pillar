${slide:title=Agile Programming}$

Pharo programming culture is agile programming
- Incremental, early feedback
- Be prepared for changes
- Driven by human
- Supported by automated tests

${slide:title=SUnit}$

- Extremely simple (4 classes)
- Originally developed by K. Beck (agile programming father)
- Got copied all over the places

${slide:title=A Test}$

In a test, we 
- Create a context: Create an empty set
- Send a stimulus: Add twice the same element
- Check the results: Check that the set contains only one element

${slide:title=Set TestCase}$

[[[
TestCase subclass: # SetTestCase
    ...
]]]

[[[
SetTestCase >> testAdd 
  | empty |
  empty := Set new.                      "Context"
  empty add: 5.                             "Stimulus"
  empty add: 5. 
  self assert: empty size = 1.        "Check"

SetTestCase run: #testAdd
]]]

${slide:title=In a Subclass of TestCase}$

Each method starting with ==test*==:
- Represents a test
- Is automatically executed
The results of the test are collected in a ==TestResult== object

${slide:title=Another example}$

[[[
testAdjacentRunsWithEqualsAttributesAreMerged
  "this demonstrates that adjancent runs with equal attributes are merged. "
  | runArray |
  runArray := RunArray new.
  runArray
    addLast: TextEmphasis normal times: 5;
    addLast: TextEmphasis bold times: 5;
    addLast: TextEmphasis bold times: 5.
  self assert: (runArray runs size = 2).
]]]

${slide:title=Failures and Errors}$

- A failure is a failed assertion, i.e., an anticipated problem that you test
- An error is a condition you didn't check for

${slide:title=To Test That an Error Must Be Raised}$

[[[
SetTestCase >> removeElementNotInSet
  self should: [ Set new remove: 1 ] raise: NotFound
]]]

${slide:title=To Test That an Error Must Not Be Raised}$

[[[
SetTestCase >> removeElementNotInSet
  self shouldnt: [ Set new add: 1 ] raise: NotFound
]]]

${slide:title=Duplicating the Context}$

[[[
SetTestCase >> testOccurrences
  | empty |
  empty := Set new.
  self assert: (empty occurrencesOf: 0) equals: 0.
  empty add: 5; add: 5.
  self assert: (empty occurrencesOf: 5) equals: 1
]]]

- ==empty := Set new.== is repeated between tests
- We can factor it out


${slide: setUp and tearDown Messages}$
- Executed systematically before and after each test run
- ==setUp== allows us to specify and reuse the context
- ==tearDown== to clean after

${slide:title=Definiting a setUp Method}$

[[[
SetTestCase >> setUp
  empty := Set new
]]]

 ==setUp== is executed for you before any test execution

[[[
SetTestCase >> testOccurrences
  self assert: (empty occurrencesOf: 0) equals: 0.
  empty add: 5; add: 5.
  self assert: (empty occurrencesOf: 5) equals: 1
]]]


${slide:title=SUnit Core}$

+>file://figures/SUnitCore.png+

${slide:title=TestSuite, TestCase and TestResult}$

- A ==TestCase== represents one test
-- the method: ==SetTestCase >> testOccurenceOf==
- A ==TestSuite== is a group of tests
-- SUnit automatically builds a suite from the methods starting with =='test*'==
- A ==TestResult== represents a test execution results

${slide:title=Test Resources}$

A ==TestResource== is an object which is needed by a number
of Test Cases, and whose instantiation is so costly in terms
of time or resources that it becomes advantageous to only
initialize it once for a Test Suite run.

A ==TestResources== is invoked once before any test is run.
(read Pharo by Example SUnit Chapter)

${slide:title=What you should know}$

- How to write simple tests
- Reuse a bit the context by defining ==setUp== methodss

${slide:title=Summary}$

- Unit tests are easy to create and run
- Use them as your life insurance
- There exists other libraries for Mock (BabyMock) or different styles of testing
