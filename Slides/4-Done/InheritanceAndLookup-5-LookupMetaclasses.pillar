${slide:title=Goal}$

-Messages can be sent to classes too
-The mechanism is ""exactly"" the same

${slide:title=Lookup of Class Methods is No Different}$

- Sending a message to a class is also late-bound (dynamically resolved)
-- contrary to Java/C#
-- no ==static==, only methods of another object (a class)

- Only one rule:
--when a message is sent to an object, a method is searched starting from the class of the object and following the inheritance chain

${slide:title=A Class is an Instance of Another Class}$

- A class ==X== is always the unique instance of another class ==X class==
-- The class of ==Node== is ==Node class==
