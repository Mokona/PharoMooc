!! Distributions: towards a certified catalog

- I want to go to Mars with just a DVD,
- and still be able to load the projects I want,
- and get the right ones loaded.

+>file://figures/ApplicationDistribution.png+

!! Process

- You use Metacello!
- You publish in your repo!
- When you want you can release code to a distribution
- All the code then is recursively copied to the distribution space
- All the tests and quality rules are checked
- People use your code but with a certain level of confidence :)
