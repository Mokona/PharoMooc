}


${slide:title=What you will learn}$

- Lookup of class methods are the same as instance methods
- Class methods are not (java like) static methods
- Class methods are plain normal methods

${slide:title=There is only One Way}$

When we send messages to an instance, corresponding methods are looked up in the instance class and applied to that instance


${slide:title=Remember: Sending a message}$

${columns}$

${column:width=40}$

Sending a message to an object
- go to the class of the object
- look for the method associated to the message selector
- follow the inheritance chain
- apply the found method to the receiver

${slide:title=Sending a message to a class}$

${columns}$

${column:width=50}$

Sending a message to a ==Counter== (a class)
- go to the class of the class (==Node class==)
- follow the inheritance chain (up to ==Object class== and upper)
- apply the found method to the receiver: the class ==Counter==

${slide:title=Stepping back}$

${columns}$

${column:width=50}$

- There is only one way to find and execute messages!
- instance/class and class/superclass relations are systematically followed

${slide:title=Class is just an instance}$

A class is an object instance of another class (called a metaclass)
- A metaclass is just one class whose instances are classes! 
- ==Counter== is the unique instance of the class ==Counter class==
- ==Counter class== is automatically created when you create the class ==Counter==
- The class of class ==XXX== is named ==XXX class==


${slide:title=Class as objects}$

Yes the browser is helping you to edit two classes: a class and its class

${slide:title=What you should know}$

- Messages sent to classes are resolved the same way as messages sent to instances.
- Class methods are
-- public
-- late-bound
- Classes are just objects too.
- Classes are instance of other classes (called metaclasses).
